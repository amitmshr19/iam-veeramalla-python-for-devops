# Arithmetic Operations in Python

## Introduction

Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values. These operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## List of Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (+):** Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
3. **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (/):** Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
5. **Floor Division (//):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
6. **Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
7. **Exponentiation (**):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

## Examples

### Addition

```python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Subtraction

```python
x = 10
y = 7
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 3

### Regular division,Floor division

```python
# Regular division
result = 7 / 3
print(result)  # Output: 2.3333333333333335
Floor Division (//):
python
Copy code
# Floor division
result_floor = 7 // 3
print(result_floor)  # Output: 2
In the first example, the division operator (/) gives a floating-point result, and in the second example, the floor division operator (//) provides the result rounded down to the nearest whole number.

###
Certainly! Let's look at examples for the modulus operator (%) and the exponentiation operator (**):

Modulus (%):
python
Copy code
# Modulus operation
remainder = 7 % 3
print(remainder)  # Output: 1
In this example, the modulus operator (%) calculates the remainder of the division of 7 by 3, which is 1.

Exponentiation (**) :
python
Copy code
# Exponentiation
result_exponentiation = 2 ** 3
print(result_exponentiation)  # Output: 8
In this example, the exponentiation operator (**) raises the left operand (2) to the power of the right operand (3), resulting in 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
