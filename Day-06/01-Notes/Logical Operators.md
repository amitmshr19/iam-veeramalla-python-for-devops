# Logical Operations in Python

## Introduction

Logical operators in Python are used to manipulate and combine Boolean values. These operators allow you to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.

## List of Logical Operators

1. **AND (and):** Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
2. **OR (or):** Returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.
3. **NOT (not):** Returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.

## Examples

### AND Operator

```python
x = True
y = False
result = x and y
# result will be False
```

### OR Operator

```python
a = True
b = False
result = a or b
# result will be True
```

### Logical NOT
```python
Certainly! Here's another example of the logical NOT (not) operator:

is_sunny = True
is_raining = not is_sunny

print(is_raining)  # Output: False
In this example, the variable is_raining is assigned the opposite Boolean value of is_sunny using the not operator. If is_sunny is True, then is_raining will be False, and if is_sunny is False, then is_raining will be True.
```
